# Alram220
This is a final project for ELEC 220, I use a micro-controller with extension modules to create an overheat alarm. 
ELEC 220 is the Fundamental Electrical Engineering, I learnt a lot about computer architecture and C languages. As for the final project, I used Tiva TM4C1236GHPM from Texas Instruments and Grove extension modules from Seed Studio to create an overheat alarm.
